A detailed explanation between Object Oriented Programming and Procedural Programming

## Differences Between OOP and Procedural ##

In order to do that we will have to take a step back and understand what are the main difference among them. Until now, you probably coded in whatâ€™s called procedural programming. You write your PHP at the beginning of the page, creating vairables and post method inputs to error handle or whatever your programming. It is fine to work like that, if you need to build something very small this could actually be a good idea because this creates less verbose code that in OOP, but there are several problems with this approach that will show up later on in your code.

To begin with, in the procedural way the possibility to reuse the code is very limited if not impossible. If you need to use the same block of code twice you need to rewrite it again somewhere else, if you need to update a functionality you will eventually need to edit all code blocks that had the same function, and if you forget a block this will lead to problems and errors that will be really difficult to be spotted later on.

On the other hand, OOP concepts solve these problems while adding new features that provide a modular structure to your project and make it very easy to maintain the existing code which results in much more flexibility, just by using objects and classes.

## Object Oriented ##

Object-oriented programming is a style of coding that allows developers to group similar tasks into classes. The allows you to not repeat code over and over again. 

One of the major benefits of not repeating code is that, if a piece of information changes in your program, usually only one change is required to update the code. One of the biggest problem developers have whilst programming is maintaining code where data is declared more than once in a document.

To 
A class, for example, is like a blueprint for a house. It defines the shape of the house on paper, with relationships between the different parts of the house clearly defined and planned out, even though the house doesn't exist.

An object, then, is like the actual house built according to that blueprint. The data stored in the object is like the wood, wires, and concrete that compose the house: without being assembled according to the blueprint, it's just a pile of stuff. However, when it all comes together, it becomes an organized, useful house.
